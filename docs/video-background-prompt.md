# Hero Section Background Video Prompt

## Video Generation Prompt

Create a premium, professional background video for a business growth consulting website. The video should be **1920x1080 resolution, 10-15 seconds duration, seamlessly looping**.

### Visual Style & Theme
- **Modern, clean, premium business aesthetic**
- **Color palette**: Soft blues (#3B82F6), indigo (#6366F1), and purple (#8B5CF6) gradients with white/light gray backgrounds
- **Subtle, elegant animation** - nothing too flashy or distracting
- **Professional corporate feel** suitable for middle-market business executives

### Key Animation Elements

#### 1. Animated Growth Arrow (Primary Focus)
- **Large, prominent curved arrow** that sweeps upward from bottom-left to top-right
- **Progressive drawing animation**: Arrow draws itself smoothly over 3-4 seconds
- **Gradient coloring**: Blue to purple gradient (#3B82F6 → #6366F1 → #8B5CF6)
- **Smooth, curved path** indicating organic growth trajectory
- **Arrow thickness**: Bold but elegant (4-6px stroke weight)
- **Arrow head**: Clean, modern triangular point that appears last

#### 2. Growth Indicators
- **Small circular dots** that appear along the arrow path sequentially
- **Increasing size**: Start small at bottom, grow larger toward the top
- **Subtle glow effect** with matching blue/purple colors
- **Timing**: Appear 0.5 seconds after arrow section is drawn

#### 3. Background Elements
- **Subtle geometric patterns**: Light, translucent shapes in background
- **Soft gradient overlays**: Radial gradients creating depth
- **Minimal particle effects**: Very subtle floating geometric shapes
- **Professional grid or dot pattern**: Barely visible, adds sophistication

### Animation Sequence (10-second loop)
1. **Seconds 0-1**: Clean background with subtle gradients
2. **Seconds 1-4**: Arrow draws progressively from bottom to top
3. **Seconds 4-6**: Growth indicators appear sequentially
4. **Seconds 6-8**: Subtle pulsing effect at arrow tip
5. **Seconds 8-10**: Hold final state, prepare for seamless loop

### Technical Requirements
- **Format**: MP4, H.264 codec
- **Resolution**: 1920x1080 (Full HD)
- **Duration**: 10-15 seconds
- **Seamless loop**: Ending frame should transition smoothly to beginning
- **No audio**: Silent background video
- **Optimized file size**: Web-optimized for fast loading

### Brand Context
This is for **SOAR Growth**, a premium business growth consulting firm serving middle-market companies ($10M-$1B revenue). The video will serve as a background for the hero section featuring the headline "Stop Working Harder. Start Growing Faster."

### Mood & Feel
- **Professional confidence**
- **Growth and progress**
- **Upward momentum**
- **Success and achievement**
- **Premium, sophisticated**
- **Clean and modern**

### What to Avoid
- Overly busy or distracting animations
- Bright, flashy colors
- Stock photo people or faces
- Generic business icons
- Cliché corporate imagery
- Anything that would compete with text overlay

### Additional Notes
The arrow should be the hero element - everything else should be subtle and supportive. Think Apple or Google-level design sophistication. The video should enhance the premium feel of the brand while clearly communicating "growth" and "upward trajectory."

## Alternative Variations to Consider

1. **Multiple Arrows**: 3-4 smaller arrows converging into one large arrow
2. **Data Visualization**: Subtle chart elements showing upward trends
3. **Path Animation**: Arrow following a winding but always-upward path
4. **Geometric Growth**: Abstract shapes growing and ascending

## Implementation Notes

Once generated, the video should be:
- Placed in `/src/assets/` directory
- Named `hero-background.mp4`
- Referenced in the hero section component
- Set to autoplay, loop, and muted
- Positioned as background with text overlay capabilities
